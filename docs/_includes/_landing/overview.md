Jetray
======

**Jetray** is a lightweight toolkit that enables the rapid creation, development
and deployment of JavaScript-centric (ok, React and Angular) portlets for
Liferay DXP.

**Jetray** is built around the tools you’re familiar with (yeoman, npm, gulp,
webpack) from a standard UX development environment, but also supports using
Gradle as a primary build system and hides all the gory details of deploying
your portlets into the Liferay DXP server environment. You can also use
techniques like “watch” and “live reload” for your portlet-based development.
