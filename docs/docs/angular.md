### Angular Portlet

#### CSS/SCSS

SASS support for Angular portlet projects is optionally available when generating a new project. Enable the SASS (.scss) option by responding _y_ at the _Include support for SASS (.scss)?_ prompt, then change `.css` files to `.scss` to begin using SASS in your project.

_Note: Be sure to update the references in your Angular components to reflect the updated file extension._
