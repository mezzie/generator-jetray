Website: [https://xtivia.github.io/generator-jetray](https://xtivia.github.io/generator-jetray)

TL;DR

1. clone this repository...

2. make sure you have yo and gulp-cli installed globally via npm...

3. cd into the cloned directory....

4. run 'npm link'

5. then create a new portlet project directory, cd into it, and run 'yo jetray' and follow prompts

6. run 'gulp build' 

7. when ready, run 'gulp deploy' to push to Liferay

NOTE: beginning with version 1.6.0 Angular support has been migrated to Angular 4 and moves the UI-Router package to @uirouter/angular as well.

For those not ready to move to Angular 4, the version that supports Angular 2 is still provided
as a Git 1.5.1 tag here.
