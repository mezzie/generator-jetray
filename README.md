# Jetray
Yeoman generator for React, Angular and (v2.0+) Vue portlets on Liferay DXP

NOTE: As of v2.1, JetRay optionally supports using yarn as your package manager (instead of npm) for Javascript-centric (non-Gradle) builds.

TL;DR

1. make sure you have node installed, and then packages yo and gulp-cli installed globally via npm...

2. run 'npm i -g xtivia/generator-jetray'

3. create a new portlet project directory, cd into it, and run 'yo jetray' and follow the prompts

4. run 'gulp build' 

5. when ready, run 'gulp deploy' to push to Liferay

6. Enjoy seeing your SPA portlet in Liferay
