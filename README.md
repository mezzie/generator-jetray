# Jetray
Yeoman generator for React and Angular portlets on Liferay DXP

[https://xtivia.github.io/generator-jetray](https://xtivia.github.io/generator-jetray)

TL;DR

1. make sure you have node installed, and then packages yo and gulp-cli installed globally via npm...

2. run 'npm i -g xtivia/generator-jetray'

3. create a new portlet project directory, cd into it, and run 'yo jetray' and follow the prompts

4. run 'gulp build' 

5. when ready, run 'gulp deploy' to push to Liferay

NOTE: beginning with version 1.6.0 Angular support has been migrated to Angular 4 and moves the UI-Router package to @uirouter/angular as well.

For those not ready to move to Angular 4, the version that supports Angular 2 is still provided
as a Git 1.5.1 tag here.
